Develop a mobile application to help parents track their baby’s sleep and predict the next optimal nap time. The app will leverage the GPT API for intelligent analysis of sleep patterns, providing predictions based on recorded data.

Core Features:

1. Child Management:
    - Add a child profile (name, birth date, gender)
    - Add multiple children
    - Edit or delete child information
2. Sleep Tracking:
    - Start sleep tracking (specifying exact start time or chose “now”)
    - End sleep tracking (specifying exact wake-up time or chose “Still sleeping”) - Indicate if the child is still sleeping
    - Track sleep (start and end times)
3. Sleep Quality Assessment:
    - Rate the quality of sleep (options: slept well, woke up often, cried, tossed a lot)
4. Sleep Prediction:
    - Predict the next sleep window using the GPT API
    - Show bedtime
    - Show the time until bedtime
